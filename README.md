This game is developed in java swing using netbeans. This game has 2 buttons. One buttons is to generate a random game and one button to solve it. I have initialy added 3 sudoku games in it. When the generate new game button is pressed, the program will randomly select a game 
from these three games and print it on JFrame. When the solve button is pressed, the program will try to find the solution for that game using an algorithm that I have designed my self. The max time that I have got on my machine to solve any sudoku game is less than a seconds. The logic that I have applied for the algoithm is iterative. I have also included a library named "JTattoo". The only use of this libary is to make Java Swing components more beautiful and impressive.
